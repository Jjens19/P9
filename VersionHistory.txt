Alpha V1.0
	- Basic dumbbell topology
	- TCP connection
	- 10 nodes and 2 switches
	- Adjustable data rate between switches (ln 64)
	- Adjustable data rate for individual nodes
	- Default TCP congestion control algorithm (CUBIC) [https://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/tcp.html]
	- Basic logging of packets sent between nodes
	- You can specify what nodes communicate with who and for how long
	- Nodes send a constant stream of packets to the receiver for the specified amount of time
	
Current topology:

	N0         N5
    N1  |          |  N6
      \ |          | /
  N2-- S1----------S2 --N7
      / |          | \
    N3  |          |  N8
        N4         N9
        
        
        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha V1.1
	- Added custom congestion control algorithm which
		increases by 10 if there is no congestion
		decreases by 10 if there is congestion
		

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha V1.2
	- Custom congestion control algorithm now reads a value from a file
		The algorithm sets the cWnd to this value, instead of adding or subtracting
	- Tracks and prints the following values
		Amount of packets sent over a given time
		Amount of ACKs received over a given time
		Amount of bytes sent over a given time
		Sum of RTT between sent packets and their respective ACKs
	- Simulation now runs in specified fixed-length segments 
		until no packets are sent and no ACKs are received
		

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha V1.2.2
	- Reimplemented the OnOff helpers for each node
